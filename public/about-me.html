<br>
<p>Hiya üëã,</p>
<br>
<p>If you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôve probably clicked through from another post or are just curious as to who I am. I‚Äôll try and answer that by outlining the events and experiences that have shaped both me and my perspective.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="Who I am">Who I am</h3>
<p>I‚Äôm Essa Saulat. I‚Äôm originally from Karachi, spent a few years in Kuala Lumpur and then came to the UK to attend the Oxford University Software Incubator. I‚Äôve been here ever since, despite the rain and lack of sunshine!</p>
<br>
<p>It‚Äôs hard to put ‚Äúme‚Äù into a box, as who I am is in a constant state of flux. This is especially true in recent years as an unexpected illness forced me to re-evaluate how I see myself and the world. This led to two core realisations:</p>
<br>
<ol start="1"><li>I was stuck in a firefighting loop, a side effect of my difficult past, even though the fires were put out long ago.
</li></ol>
<br>
<ol start="2"><li>I had accepted certain universal and culture specific ‚Äútruths‚Äù without questioning if they were logically sound. Spoiler alert‚Ä¶ most weren‚Äôt.
</li></ol>
<br>
<p>Since then, I‚Äôve tried to continually question and consciously shape who I am, rather than be defined by past circumstances.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="My work">My work</h2>
<p>Simply put, I like building things and helping people.</p>
<br>
<p>I‚Äôm currently Chief Growth Officer at Symptoma, Startup Mentor at Oxford University Innovation and also volunteer as an independent startup mentor. Previously, I was Head of Product and Marketing at  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/19/uks-zilch-raises-80m-at-a-500m-valuation-for-its-direct-to-consumer-buy-now-pay-later-service/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAK31MW_KVYZBUmjaGikmeJRS9XgWr_Kc-RV9L54yhUG9jTmyvkwU1QtijR5dGn30JFUat9GoO3JD_rad4u_7U78qzcbd6TV8ZIL2ByB50cUNKEKO8ZGWxGA3Z6W2qL1A26gzvskPJSQiafedwPhzQWkQjaLs3kU1YJvU8v-9q3gI">Zilch</a>  (a London based fin-tech currently valued at over half a billion USD).</p>
<br>
<p>I‚Äôve founded a few startups of my own, the most recent being  <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/97778c1a-26a9-11e7-a34a-538b4cb30025">Esplorio</a> , which raised over 1 million USD with backing from VCs, British Airways, the ESA BIC and Google.</p>
<br>
<p>In the course of my career, I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to work with and learn from organisations such as Apple, British Airways, the United Nations, MasterCard, General Assembly and Flatiron School.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="Startup mentoring">Startup mentoring</h2>
<p>I owe a lot of my success as a founder to a long list of amazingly talented mentors, to whom I‚Äôm eternally grateful. I mentor startups not only to pass this forward, but also because I truly enjoy it!</p>
<br>
<p>Specifically, I offer help in the fields of entrepreneurship, design and marketing. I‚Äôm relatively sector agnostic, having helped startups that range from one building new forms of <a href="https://www.magdrivespace.com">electric propulsion for satellites</a>, to another using behavioural science to <a href="https://routinery.app">help people with ADHD build consistent habits</a>.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="What this blog is about">What this blog is about</h2>
<p>This blog is intentionally broad. The following topics are of particular interest, so are likely to get a bit more love:</p>
<br>
<ul><li>Productivity & Self Efficacy
</li><li>Mental Health
</li><li>Startup Lessons
</li></ul>
<br>
<p>For four years, I‚Äôve been writing just for myself. Writing in a public medium however, helps me adopt a more critical mindset which encourages brevity and clarity. </p>
<p>This enables me to better distill and develop my ideas, plus share them with anyone who might find them useful. If you‚Äôre one such person, enjoy!</p>
<br>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Essa</p>

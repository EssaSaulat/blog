        The Bear minimum - Building a super simple blog with Bear.app
      </h1>
      <p>
        <b>TLDR:</b> Create a super simple minimalist blog with little to no coding
        experience. Get <a href="https://bear.app" target="_blank">Bear</a> (only available on
        Apple devices), export notes as HTML files, upload to GitHub, then link
        to host/domain. Profit!
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I love things that are stripped down to the bare essentials, but still
        do their job well. I try to replicate this in both my personal and work
        life. Here‚Äôs why:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Big chunky things = Scary</p>
      <p>Scary = Never gets done</p>
      <p>Small and super simple = Gets done</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        To get stuff done, I break down and simplify tasks to a degree that some
        might consider excessive. This forcing function also helps me consider
        and address core issues versus symptoms. This post is about how I used
        this approach to quickly create a blog.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Having used Bear for years to keep a daily journal, I decided to start writing online. With Bear as the inspiration, I listed what I needed
        <b>now</b>, ignoring what I might one day use. The first approach leads to a simple but finished project, the momentum of a win, and the option for future
        improvements. The latter invites indecision, complexity, delays, and usually doesn‚Äôt get me very far.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>My ideal blog needed to be:</p>
      <ol start="1">
        <li>Self hosted on a custom domain.</li>
        <li>Exceedingly easy to set up and update.</li>
        <li>Text based. Images were not an immediate priority.</li>
        <li>Styled for readability.</li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <p>
        By listing problems <b>before</b> looking for solutions, I can quickly
        filter results that don‚Äôt match. I‚Äôm then less likely to fall prey to
        premature optimisation, marketing or <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/aesthetic-usability-effect/" target="_blank">aesthetic usability bias</a>.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Most solutions (including Wordpress) simply did too much. Paradox of
        choice was another issue. Having so many off-the-shelf options, each
        with a microcosm of near infinite themes and widgets, was just too overwhemling. 
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I took a step back and considered if my time would instead be better spent building a blog from scratch. A quick Google once again
        presented a paradox of choice; an endless number of ways or frameworks to choose from. I‚Äôm not a programmer and didn‚Äôt know where to start, so
        I took another step back. I drew up a simple plan, filled in some blanks, and decided to ask a friend about the rest.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I realised that Bear could export notes in HTML, including all the CSS styling at the bottom. This was a huge win as I could use Bear to create a simple home               
        page with a title, a paragraph, and an unordered list of links to individual posts. As for the posts themselves, I just needed to write them up in Bear 
        and export them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Enter <a href="https://kasun.io" target="_blank">Kasun</a>, a friend, indie-hacker and
        freelance programmer (who‚Äôs currently working remotely while travelling
        across Sri Lanka). He was kind enough to teach me some basics about
        HTML, hosting, and linking domains. Here‚Äôs what we did:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ol start="1">
        <li>Create and export notes from Bear.</li>
        <li>Create a <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> account and paste the
          exported code into a project.
        </li>
        <li>Use <a href="https://vercel.com" target="_blank">Vercel‚Äôs</a> free tier for hosting
          and link to Github.
        </li>
        <li>Link domain to Vercel.</li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <p>
        That‚Äôs pretty much it really. For someone familiar with the basics, it
        would have taken under 15 mins to have a minimalist, well styled, and
        self-hosted blog, all without writing a single line of code.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In the end, not only did I get my blog, but I also learned some basic
        web development! It‚Äôs a big win in my book and I wanted to share this
        post in case others (especially other Bear fans) want to do something
        similar.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Considering the number of available options, it‚Äôs likely that I missed something that would have been a good fit. If so, feel free to tweet me a link.
        </li>
        <li>This blog is the first website I‚Äôve built and has helped me realise that code isn‚Äôt as ‚Äúscary‚Äù as I once thought üòä.
        </li>
        <li>Images aren‚Äôt included by default in Bear HTML exports. To include them, you have to manually upload the picture to your GitHub project and then include a link in the relevant HTML file as part of an image tag.
        </li>
        <li>Developer friends have mentioned that the formatting of the exported html file isn‚Äôt great. While not a huge problem for me, I will use it as a way to learn more about formatting best practices.
        </li>
        <li>Big thanks to the talented <a href="https://kasun.io" target="_blank">Kasun</a> for
          the help! I can‚Äôt recommend him enough if you‚Äôre on the lookout for a
          freelance developer. If you‚Äôre a designer, be sure to check out
          <a href="https://whatthehex.app" target="_blank">What the Hex?!</a>, one of his
          projects that lets you quickly assign names to your design system
          colour palette.
        </li>
        <li>If you‚Äôd like to build something similar and have questions, I‚Äôd love
          to hear from you!
        </li>

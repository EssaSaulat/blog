        The meta problem with startup advice
      </h1>
      <p>
        An essay on how more often than not, advice is either disregarded or not
        strongly considered, till a person falls into a hole and realises the
        value of it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3 id="Things to consider">Things to consider</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Is the pain or experience of falling into the relevant hole (vs a
          general one) absolutely needed, or is there a possible way to avoid
          this?
        </li>
        <li>
          While advice will be weighted based on apparent/perceived authority or
          “success” of the advisor, is that the core issue here? For example,
          unless I’m mistaken, I’ve heard that even for people like PG, people
          often don’t understand or realise the value of his advice like “make
          something people want” or “do things that don’t scale”. I wonder if
          the difference lies in if that statement alone is given or if it is
          accompanied my metaphors of specific examples to help drive home the
          point.
        </li>
        <li>
          Is the issue with the advice, the way the advice is given, with the
          advisor, or with the recipient? What is the assumed order of influence
          in the likelihood of understanding/application? What are ways to
          counter this?
